# Memoria
## Inspiration
Our inspiration towards this app was because we wanted help out seniors. We know they have trouble in their final years in their lives.

## What it does
It includes memory-strengthening exercises, and a journal to take pictures and store memories. We also include their medical and personal information, in case they forget.

## How we built it
We built it using Xcode 10 and Swift 4.

## What's next for Memoria
We will add notifications, so the user can remember to do daily activities such as calling their child, or taking their daily medicine.
